## Overview

Successfully implemented a production-ready drop folder system for automated test case generation from natural language requirements. The system integrates the RAG+HRM hybrid workflow to generate high-quality test cases automatically when requirement files are dropped into the input folder.

## Implementation Date

October 8, 2025

---

## Components Implemented

### 1. Natural Language Parser (`hrm_eval/requirements_parser/nl_parser.py`)

  - Markdown headers
  - Free text with bullet points
- Regex-based pattern matching for robust parsing
- Fallback handling for unstructured text
- Comprehensive logging

**Key Classes:**
