## Root Cause Analysis of Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Data Format Inconsistency

**Problem:** Training data contained mixed formats (SQE: prompt/completion vs HRM: input_sequence/target_sequence)

**Root Cause:** SQE augmentation data was not converted to HRM format

**Fix:** Implemented `_convert_sqe_to_hrm_format()` in `TrainingDataCollector` to ensure consistent format

**Testing:** Added comprehensive unit tests for format conversion

### Issue 2: Variable-Length Sequence Handling

**Problem:** RuntimeError during batching due to mismatched tensor sizes

**Root Cause:** `collate_fn` assumed input and target sequences had identical lengths

**Fix:** Modified `collate_fn` to calculate and use separate max lengths for input and target

**Impact:** Enabled proper batching of variable-length sequences

### Issue 3: Missing Custom Collate Function

**Problem:** Initial training attempts used PyTorch's default collate_fn

**Root Cause:** `collate_fn` import missing from fine_tuner.py DataLoader initialization

**Fix:** Added `collate_fn` import and specified it in DataLoader creation

**Impact:** Ensured proper padding and batching of sequences

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Use Fine-Tuned Model:** The fine-tuned checkpoint shows clear improvements and should be deployed for media fulfillment test generation

2. **Checkpoint Location:** `fine_tuned_checkpoints/media_fulfillment/checkpoint_epoch_3_best.pt`

3. **Continue Feedback Loop:** Collect real user feedback on generated tests to further improve the model

4. **Monitor Performance:** Track test case quality metrics in production

5. **Periodic Retraining:** Retrain with new data as more requirements and feedback are collected
