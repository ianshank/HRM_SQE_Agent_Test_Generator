## Executive Summary

Fixed 2 high-priority issues identified in automated code reviews from GitHub Copilot and Gemini Code Assist. Both issues violated DRY principles and configuration centralization goals. All tests passing (78/78) after fixes.

## Issue #1: Code Duplication - checkpoint_step Extraction

### Root Cause

**Location:** `hrm_eval/core/model_manager.py` line 239-245

**Problem:** The `_extract_checkpoint_step()` method was duplicated in two places:
1. `ModelManager._extract_checkpoint_step()` - Private method (239-245)
2. `extract_checkpoint_step()` in `common_utils.py` (line 437+)

**Why It Happened:**
- During refactoring, extracted common functionality to `common_utils.py`
- Forgot to update `ModelManager` to use the centralized function
- Both implementations were identical, violating DRY principle

**Impact:**
- Maintenance overhead: Changes needed in two places
- Inconsistency risk: If one gets updated, the other might not
- Code smell: Duplication indicates poor abstraction

### Solution Implemented

**Changed `ModelManager._extract_checkpoint_step()` from:**
```python
def _extract_checkpoint_step(self, checkpoint_name: str) -> Optional[int]:
    """Extract step number from checkpoint name."""
    import re
    match = re.search(r'step_(\d+)', checkpoint_name)
    if match:
        return int(match.group(1))
    return None
```

**To:**
```python
def _extract_checkpoint_step(self, checkpoint_name: str) -> Optional[int]:
    """
    Extract step number from checkpoint name.
    
    Delegates to centralized function in common_utils to avoid duplication.
    
    Args:
        checkpoint_name: Checkpoint name
        
    Returns:
        Step number or None
    """
    from .common_utils import extract_checkpoint_step
    return extract_checkpoint_step(checkpoint_name)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single source of truth for checkpoint step extraction
- ✅ Changes to logic only needed in one place
- ✅ Reduced maintenance overhead
- ✅ Follows DRY principle

**Testing:**
```bash
# Verified extraction still works
python -c "from hrm_eval.core.model_manager import ModelManager; \
from hrm_eval.utils import load_system_config; \
config = load_system_config(); \
mgr = ModelManager(config); \
step = mgr._extract_checkpoint_step('checkpoints_hrm_v9_optimized_step_7566'); \
print(f'✓ Extracted step: {step}')"
# Output: ✓ Extracted step: 7566
```

## Issue #2: Hard-coded Default Checkpoint

### Root Cause

**Location:** `hrm_eval/core/test_generation_pipeline.py` line 245

**Problem:** Hard-coded default checkpoint value `"step_7566"` in `_load_model()` method

```python
def _load_model(self, checkpoint_name: Optional[str] = None):
    """Load HRM model via model manager."""
    if checkpoint_name is None:
        checkpoint_name = "step_7566"  # ❌ HARD-CODED!
        logger.debug(f"Using default checkpoint: {checkpoint_name}")
    
    return self.model_manager.load_model(checkpoint_name, use_cache=True)
```

**Why It Happened:**
- Placeholder value used during initial implementation
- Meant to be replaced with config value but was overlooked
- Inconsistent with goal of eliminating all hard-coded values

**Impact:**
- Configuration goal violated (88% reduction target not met)
- Cannot change default checkpoint without code modification
- Inconsistent with rest of refactoring (everything else uses config)
- Deployment complexity: Different environments need different defaults

### Solution Implemented

**Step 1: Added to `system_config.yaml`:**
```yaml
model:
  # Default checkpoint selection
  default_checkpoint: "step_7566"  # Default checkpoint to use when not specified
  
  # Checkpoint loading
  strict_loading: false
  load_optimizer_state: false
  # ... rest of config
```

**Step 2: Updated Pydantic model in `unified_config.py`:**
```python
class ModelConfigOverrides(BaseModel):
    """Model configuration overrides."""
    default_checkpoint: str = Field(
        default="step_7566",
        description="Default checkpoint to use when not specified"
    )
    
    strict_loading: bool = False
    # ... rest of fields
```

**Step 3: Updated `test_generation_pipeline.py`:**
```python
def _load_model(self, checkpoint_name: Optional[str] = None):
    """Load HRM model via model manager."""
    if checkpoint_name is None:
        checkpoint_name = self.config.model.default_checkpoint  # ✅ FROM CONFIG!
        logger.debug(f"Using default checkpoint from config: {checkpoint_name}")
    
    return self.model_manager.load_model(checkpoint_name, use_cache=True)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero hard-coded values in core logic (configuration goal achieved)
- ✅ Easy to change default checkpoint via config file
- ✅ Environment-specific defaults possible (dev vs prod)
- ✅ Consistent with rest of refactoring architecture
- ✅ Type-safe with Pydantic validation

**Testing:**
```bash
# Verified config field is accessible
python -c "from hrm_eval.utils import load_system_config; \
config = load_system_config(); \
print(f'✓ default_checkpoint: {config.model.default_checkpoint}')"
# Output: ✓ default_checkpoint: step_7566

# Verified all tests still pass
pytest hrm_eval/tests/test_unified_config.py \
      hrm_eval/tests/test_model_manager.py \
      hrm_eval/tests/test_common_utils.py -v
# Result: 78 passed, 22 warnings in 0.88s
```

   - Human review missed these issues
   - Bot reviews provided valuable second opinion
   - Combination of human + bot reviews is optimal

3. **Configuration Coverage:**
   - Need systematic approach to find all hard-coded values
   - Should audit codebase with regex: `"step_\d+"`, `top_k = \d+`, etc.
   - Create checklist for configuration items
