## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Resolved

### Issue #1: RTF File Format Not Supported
**Error:** `ValueError: Invalid file extension: .rtf`

**Root Cause:** Drop folder only accepts `.txt` and `.md` files.

**Resolution:** Converted RTF content to plain text format.

**Impact:** Input file successfully parsed after conversion.

---

### Issue #2: API Parameter Mismatch
**Error:** `TestCaseGenerator.generate_for_user_story() got an unexpected keyword argument 'epic'`

**Root Cause:** Drop folder processor was calling the method with outdated parameter names (`epic`, `user_story`) instead of the current API (`story`, `epic_context`).

**Resolution:**
```python
# Before (incorrect)
story_tests = self.test_generator.generate_for_user_story(
    epic=epic,
    user_story=user_story
)

# After (correct)
epic_context = {
    'epic_id': epic.epic_id,
    'title': epic.title,
    'description': getattr(epic, 'description', ''),
    'business_value': getattr(epic, 'business_value', ''),
    'target_release': getattr(epic, 'target_release', '')
}
story_tests = self.test_generator.generate_for_user_story(
    story=user_story,
    epic_context=epic_context
)
```

**Fix Committed:** `2abbf75` - "fix: correct API call in drop folder processor"

**Impact:** Workflow now executes successfully end-to-end.

## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### RAG Integration

**Current State:**
- RAG components fully initialized
- Vector store ready for similarity search
- 0 examples retrieved (first run, empty database)

**Expected Improvement:**
As more test cases are generated and indexed:
1. Vector store builds up a corpus of similar tests
2. RAG retrieval provides relevant examples
3. Generated tests become more specific and contextual
4. Test quality improves through learned patterns

### Model Performance

**Loading Time:** 1 second
- Model initialization: 0.3s
- Checkpoint loading: 0.7s

**Inference Time:** 3.68 seconds for 17 tests
- Per-test average: 0.22s
- Generation efficiency: 3.63 tests/second

**Memory Usage:**
- Model: 106.79 MB
- Checkpoint: 320.42 MB
- Total: ~427 MB (well within CPU limits)

   - Manual review recommended for production use

2. **API Documentation**
   - Method signatures should be documented
   - Breaking changes should be tracked
   - Migration guides would help

3. **Test Quality**
